# About Me

I am a DevOps/Cloud Engineer at Viasat. There I work on building and operating cloud infrastructure for a variety of services. I've had my hands on everything from Ansible, Jenkins, AWS (*and it's plethora of products*), to Kubernetes, Istio, and many other recent cloud-native tools.

I find working in that space complex, high-paced, but also very rewarding. Especially if you take the time to dig into history of why certain technologies have become ubiquitous (*looking at you Kubernetes!*). 

In general I love learning about history, from the antics of Gracchi Brothers of Ancient Rome to how bulky vacuum tube transistors came to be 50 atoms across. I believe to understand where we are going, knowing how we got here is key.

That said, if you have any good history-tech related reads please send them my way! 😉

### Other tidbits:

- I'm into bouldering (*rock climbing but on boulders instead of cliff sides*)
- Simple black coffee is my signature drink
- I have a ever growing collection of indoor plants

More details on my prior work experience can be found on my [resume](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espinm2/espinm2.github.io/refs/heads/main/assets/cv.pdf).

# Blog
I find myself in some niche stuff with lack of human friendly docs. This blog is my attempt at giving back by providing quick, high-level, visual guidance on configuring some of those newer technologies.

# Research
In a past life I did research in the [Computer Graphics Lab](http://www.cs.rpi.edu/graphics/people.html) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. There I developed a novel online architectural sketching interface for daylighting simulation, as well as experimented with wave/particle simulations for architectural acoustics prototyping.
